## Overview

Tokemak is a decentralized investment management protocol, structured as a DAO, allowing anyone to manage investments via Liquidity Directing. With Tokemak, users can utilize TOKE to direct Tokemak’s liquidity towards bootstrapping DeFi projects while earning yield for the protocol.

## M31's Investment Thesis
**1. Intersection of Web3 & DeFi**

In 2020, we saw the emergence of Decentralized Finance which saw the bootstrapping of a number of protocols that offer traditional (and new primitive) financial services using smart contracts. In 2021, we saw the emergence of DAO’s as the key stakeholderin Web3 organizations. Tokemak fits perfectly into the intersection between DeFi and Web3 in the sense that it is a decentralized investments protocol, run by a DAO that effectively becomes the liquidity layer in DeFi allowing participants to manage assets from the protocol do earn the highest yields via liquidity deployments across the DeFi ecosystem. TOKE holders form a decentralized team of asset managers. 

**2. Solution to a Critical Problem in DeFi with an Enormous TAM, Providing Steep Asymmetric Upside**

The problem of bootstrapping liquidity in DeFi is real. While yield farming did help launch a lot of the most successful DeFi protocols we use today, it also rendered a lot of them weaker –since high inflationary token emissions diluted project health, and their liquidity was at the mercy of yield farmers, who would pull their liquidityonce incentives were no longer attractive. This posed a real problem that would impact the growth and sustenance of DeFi protocols goingforward. Tokemak offers liquidity as a service allowing protocols to move away from older methods of attracting liquidity. This is a real solution to a real growing problem, which if plays out like we think will offer huge asymmetric upside. Tokemak is a 0 to 1 innovation. 

**3. Multiple Opportunities for Profit Generation via Active Network Participation Roles**

Apart from just identifying Tokemak as a protocol with large asymmetric upside and waiting for token prices to appreciate, the protocol provides participants with many opportunities to generate additional profit be it via liquidity providing (currently offering +140% APY), single asset staking (offering between +5% and +40% APY), liquidity directing (+TBD% APY), or TOKE staking (offering up to +57% APY). M31 is earning additional profits by participating in the network. 

**4. DeFi 2.0 & Protocol Owned Liquidity**

DeFi is in hyper growth mode with protocols using blockchain to build out new financial primitives that are quickly proving to be of tremendous value. In 2020 –we saw protocols like AAVE, Compound, and MakerDao dominate the space however, they have since become the base layer for another cohort of protocols that are driven by new financial primitives and the concept of protocol owned liquidity. Tokemak is strongly established as a DeFi 2.0 protocol and has outlined its long-term outlook as one that looks at building protocol owned liquidity which we believe is fundamental to the success of the next wave of DeFi protocols.  

**5. Liquidity is the Next Infrastructure Layer (Liquidity as a Service)**

The growth, operation, and sustainability of DeFi depends on liquidity, and currently a large amount of energy and capital from DAOs/Protocols are spent on liquidity mining. It’s clear that liquidity is a precious commodity that protocols require and Tokemak is the only network with a clear path to efficiently provide liquidity to the entire ecosystem. 

**6. The Singularity – DeFi’s Liquidity Blackhole**

Tokemak’s single-sided liquidity provisioning for users will attract idle assets into the protocol’s liquidity. This liquidity will earn fees and yields, and increase the value of TOKE, which will attract more assets into the protocol to earn TOKE, continuing the flywheel.The end goal is for the protocol to build up a sufficient treasury of assets such that the protocol on its own –can direct liquidity across various sectors in DeFi. 

## Technology: How Tokemak Works

**The Problem**

Protocols have 2 routes to bootstrap liquidity –liquidity mining incentives or hiring of centralized market makers. Liquidity mining has been successful in bootstrapping liquidity for protocols –however, over the long term they harm the health of a protocol –by attracting mercenary liquidity that exits the moment incentives decrease, and by diluting overall value flows to long term token holders, as the token emissions are usually farmed and “dumped” (sold for more common assets like ETH/BTC). Centralized market makers are very expensive and capital inefficient.

**The Solution: Tokemak**

Tokemak is a new DeFi primitive -an Investments DAO for DeFi pulled into3 constituent parts-Capital, Strategic decisions and Trading expertise–all of which together –provide a new way for protocols  to  generate  liquidity  without  having  to resort  to  liquidity  mining  methods,  or  hiring centralized market makers.

**How it Works**

Tokemak functions on three core components: Token Reactors, Liquidity Providers, & Liquidity Directors. 

**Token Reactors:** Token reactors are liquidity pools in which LPs can deposit assets to be directed as liquidity. Each reactor has two sides to it –an asset side, and a TOKE side. Assets for a specific reactor are paired with base assets such as ETH/USDC –and directed as liquidity across the ecosystem. This makes it very simple for users who want to provide liquidity but do not want to pair their assets as required with Uniswap.

**Liquidity  Providers:** 
Liquidity  providers  provide  single-sided  liquidity,  by depositing  assets  into specific token reactors, and in turn, earn yield as these assets are deployed as liquidity across the ecosystem –these deposits areIL-protected, as would not be the case with Uniswap.

**Liquidity Directors:** 
Liquidity Directors (LDs) utilize TOKEto control liquidity direction. They deposit TOKE in a given reactor, and use their stake as voting power to direct assets from that reactor to a destination of their choosing. The LD’s earn yields in TOKE. 

**Protocol Controlled Assets:** 
As the LDs direct protocol liquidity to various sectors of the DeFi ecosystem –this deployed liquidity begins earning fees and yields -accrue to the protocol treasury. Over time –the PCA (protocol controlled assets) can begin supplementing LP assets –such that the protocol can provide liquidity on its own. 


In a nutshell, Tokemak pulls in user’s single sided assets, pairs them with the protocol assets –and deploys those pairs across the ecosystem as liquidity –earning fees on the same. The Liquidity is directed by TOKE stakers for a specific asset. Liquidity is deployed over weekly cycles. DAOs and DeFi protocols can leverage this to direct liquidity to their projects –without the need for liquidity mining incentives.

Token (TOKE):TOKE can be seen as the ownership of part of Tokemak’s liquidity, where holders are able to direct liquidity.

## TAM & Valuation:

TOKE acts as an investments DAO as well as an infrastructure layer for liquidity in DeFi -TOKE providesliquidity for protocols to bootstrap liquidity on their platforms, while allowing LDs to direct the assets to earn the highest yield for the protocol and grow the protocol’s treasury, or PCA. It is hard to value liquidity, however its most common measure today is TVL (Total Value Locked) -We feel that DeFi TVL is a better indicator of protocol health and growth compared to DeFi Market Cap -since marketcap is contingent on factors and projects that may not be sustainable long term and includes heavy speculation.

The TAM is essentially all the liquidity in DeFi today: which stands at **$240bn**.

The value of TOKE is derived from: 

- The value of liquidity that Tokemak can provide to other protocols
- The numberof tokens that Tokemak will absorb from other protocols into their treasury 
- Fees from market making with this treasury

We believe that Tokemak's success is highly co-related to the success of the DeFi market. It is also an early stage project -so we used a Top-down model approach, valuing TOKE based on Tokemak's % capture of DeFi's total TVL, and implying a market cap based on the TVL value reached. We use a TVL/MCAP ratio to arrive at an implied market cap for Tokemak, and value TOKE based on circulating supply at that point in time.

We have taken conservative assumptions for TVL, and Market Cap growth rate, as well as token emissions.

## Key Issues & Risks

**Early-Stage Protocol:** 
Tokemak  is  a  new  protocol –barely  a  year  old –and  with  early-stage protocols  come  risks  with  respect  to  how  the  smart  contracts  perform –and  whether  they  are open to any exploits –no matter how small. We feel like this risk is relatively low –considering the protocol’s  smart  contracts  have  been  thoroughly  audited.  We  have  also  extensively  used  the protocol and can attest to the fact that it is functional without any bugs. 

**High Rewards Emissions and Large Token Vest:** 
One of the key issues withTokemak is that there is a large supply unlock of vested tokens in 2022 (56m TOKE) –as well as high rewards emissions (30% of overall supply) over the course of 5 years. This affects price as it could put unrequired sell pressure on the token. However, we againbelieve that this will be mitigated with corrections in the Token supply, and Tokemak reaching the singularity much faster than expected. Potentially, more than 20% of the Token supply may never enter circulation. 

**Open-Source Risk (Forking Risk):** 
Moderate Forking Risk –tech stack (Token Reactors) is unique to most liquidity aggregators, hence forking would be slightly hard.

## Active Network Participation

M31 is an active participant in the Tokemak ecosystem, helping earn outsized returns vs passive holding strategies.

- **Early investors in the token**: M31 quickly identified the potential impact Tokemak could have in the overall DeFi ecosystem, and was an early investor in the token. M31 is one of the largest token holders –and has significant influence over voting and governance.

- **Tokemak DAO Participant**: M31 is a major DAO Participant, since our large token position gives us significant influence over governance decisions. M31 helped spin up the first 10 asset reactors that will be used to direct liquidity.

- **Votemak Whale**: Having one of the largest TOKE positions significantly adds to potential profit-making opportunities as other ecosystem participants pay fees for M31 to delegate its votes. This is done via Votemak –and helps M31 capture significant value from Tokemak partnerships. 

- **Liquidity Providers**: M31 provides significant liquidity –as we were part of the genesis and C.o.R.E events. We currently stake TOKE in the Sushi reactor pool, ETH in the Genesis Pool, and provide significant liquidity in the form of ETH-TOKE SLP. 

- **Liquidity Directors**: M31 will have significant influence on where liquidity from the protocol will get directed across the ecosystem, when liquidity directing goes live in Jan 2022. 

- **Working with Tokemak team**: On product roadmap, new strategies, & project integrations
