Astar Network, a general-purpose smart contract platform deployed on both Polkadot and Polygon, is transitioning into Soneium, an Ethereum L2. The new project is led by Sony Block Solutions Labs, a joint venture between Sony Group and Startale (the company behind Astar Network), with the ultimate goal of optimizing monetization for Sony’s large IP portfolio. Astar’s native token, ASTR, will rebrand and become the main asset in the Soneium ecosystem.

**INVESTMENT THESIS** 
---

Top reasons why we need to own ASTR: 

1. Given the complicated structure of the Sony/Astar partnership, ASTR’s value accrual in the Soneium economy is not well known or understood by the market.  
2. Sony’s C-Suite and Board of Directors have quietly made Web3 a top strategic initiative, specifically to optimize its underperforming IP monetization efforts.  
3. The recent successes of Base (Coinbase) and TON (Telegram) illustrate the value of Web3 distribution; specifically, pairing blockchain platforms with established brands and ecosystems.  
4. Leveraging Sony's extensive IP portfolio in gaming, music, movies, and TV shows, as well as hardware and financial services businesses, Soneium will have direct access to valuable assets and distribution to a uniquely large customer base.  
5. Attractive risk/reward investment opportunity; if successful, we believe ASTR offers \~70x upside longer-term.

**KEY RISKS**
---

Top 3 reasons why this investment will fail: 

1. Base’s overwhelming success hasn’t translated into value creation for Optimism   
2. While Coinbase and Telegram were already crypto-native, Sony is an older company with much less Web3 exposure, and therefore may have a more difficult customer base for Soneium to monetize.  
3. ASTR’s long-term role and value accrual in the Soneium ecosystem is nuanced and still tentative, which may be a harder story for the market to get behind.

# **1. PROTOCOL OVERVIEW** 
 <a id="protocol-overview"></a>

Soneium is a Layer-2 solution built on the Ethereum blockchain, developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs, enhancing scalability, speed, and cost-efficiency for decentralized applications (dApps). Utilizing advanced technologies such as Optimistic Rollups, Soneium processes transactions off-chain and periodically settles them on the Ethereum mainnet, significantly reducing congestion and transaction fees associated with Layer-1 operations. Astar’s native token, ASTR, will become the main asset in the ecosystem.

Sony’s embrace of Web3 technology signals a strategic pivot aimed at revitalizing its IP monetization performance, which has fallen behind competitors like Disney in recent years. Sony, though less visible in the Web3 space compared to companies like Coinbase and Telegram, holds a unique advantage: an enormous IP portfolio and a massive, highly engaged user base spanning gaming, music, movies, TV shows, hardware devices, and financial services. 

Sony’s CEO, Kenichiro Yoshida, has made Web3 a top strategic priority for the company, in an effort to optimize long-term IP monetization. As stated in Soneium’s introductory press release: “Specifically, we will study the protection of rights to creativity created by creators, new mechanisms for returning profits to support creators and fans, and opportunities for creators to be active across the digital and real worlds.”

# **2. INVESTMENT THESIS** 
<a id="investment-thesis"></a>

1. Given the complicated structure of the Sony/Startale partnership, ASTR’s value accrual in the Soneium economy is not well known or understood by the market. This has created a highly attractive entry valuation, which we expect to re-rate significantly as Astar and Soneium continue to execute and market their plans more broadly. TON’s all-time-high FDV of $40b, as well as our expectation for Sony IP & user base monetization (more details in valuation section), suggest ASTR has a long-term upside potential of 80x+.   
2. It's important to consider the parallels between Sony's venture and the success of Base and TON blockchain. Base is currently handling 40% of all Layer 2 transactions, despite launching much later than other Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum, Linea, and Mantle. The investment thesis for TON, which reached a $40+ billion FDV earlier this year, is largely based on Telegram's massive user base and high engagement rates. This highlights the profound significance of distribution in growing Web3 ecosystems. Although Sony has kept its blockchain aspirations closer to its chest, Web3 has quietly become a top initiative internally to enhance IP monetization. This directive has come directly from Sony’s CEO, Kenichiro Yoshida, and has the support of the Board of Directors. Sony even recently acquired the crypto exchange Amber Japan earlier this year, rebranding it to S.BLOX, and is also developing its own wallet infrastructure. Furthermore, recent patents filed by Sony illustrate their strong desire to integrate Web3 into its existing IP: 
   * Blockchain-based digital rights management is a system to manage users' rights to content. [Link](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180115416A1)  
   * Serverless gaming through zero-knowledge proofs, a system where the state of a game is hosted by the players and verified by a consensus algorithm. [Link](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2021067396A1) 
3. Sony, with its wide array of products and services, generates much more revenue and has stronger user distribution than both Coinbase and Telegram. This user base spans multiple sectors—gaming (PlayStation Network has 116m MAUs), music (global leader in published music and \#2 in recorded music), movies (\>4k titles), and TV show IP (\>400 titles), as well as hardware devices (smart phones, TVs, cameras, image sensors) and financial services ($50b in life insurance policies) businesses—offering unprecedented Web3 monetization opportunities for Soneium.  

## 3\. SONY BUSINESS SEGMENTS & IP ASSETS

Sony is a Japanese multinational conglomerate headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. Best known for its electronic products, Sony offers a wide variety of product lines in many areas. The company is organized into the following business segments: Game & Network Services (G\&NS); Music; Pictures; Entertainment, Technology, & Services (ET\&S); Imaging & Sensing Solutions (I\&SS); and Financial Services.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/xCMzYSq/Screenshot-2024-09-29-at-11-44-27-AM.png" alt="image22" style="width: 100%; ">


***Evolution from Content Distribution to Content Creation***

Over the past decade, the company has had to adapt to changing market dynamics, shifting its focus from content distribution to content creation (gaming, music, movies, shows). In Sony’s latest Annual Report, COO & CFO Hiroki Totoki explained: 

*“Looking at the external environment, the entertainment market is clearly growing with the spread of streaming services and the like, and particularly the global music market has been growing (chart 3 below). Within that trend the value of content IP is rising. While Sony previously focused on the distribution side of business, delivering Kando through sales of hardware and packaged media, today it has shifted its focus to the creative side of Kando.”* 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/sHPMmZj/image15.png" alt="image22" style="width: 100%; ">




***Long-Term Vision & Web3 Alignment***

Sony’s stated 10-year vision is to “create infinite realities," integrating physical and virtual worlds, fostering limitless emotional experiences through the fusion of creativity and technology alongside creators. The vision is encapsulated in three key themes: Creativity Unleashed, Boundaries Transcended, and Narratives Everywhere. These signify Sony's intent to use technology to empower creators globally, transcend physical, virtual, and temporal boundaries, connect people across diverse communities, and collaborate with creators to craft imaginative, narrative-rich experiences that inspire and spread globally as new touchpoints for emotional engagement.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bjhT71d/image14.png" alt="image22" style="width: 100%; ">

Although neither blockchain nor Web3 are specifically mentioned in the annual report, this 10-year vision seems to perfectly align with the technical properties of blockchain and the ethos of Web3. Sony’s future IP monetization initiatives will rely heavily on blockchain, potentially making Soneium one of the largest Web3 ecosystems.

***Monetizing Sony’s IP in Web3***

Sony’s vast portfolio of content IP in gaming, music, movies, and TV shows presents immense potential for Web3-based monetization. The company has already laid the groundwork for leveraging blockchain technologies in IP protection, digital rights management, and serverless gaming through zero-knowledge proofs. Soneium will capitalize on this IP by integrating blockchain into Sony’s existing ecosystems.

Web3 has mostly failed to break into mainstream adoption with crypto-native games, music, video, and other creator content. We believe Sony has a much better chance of success because of backwards integration: plugging Web3 functionality into already established and valuable IP. Leveraging the Sony ecosystem, Soneium is uniquely positioned to meaningfully experiment, innovate, and disrupt content distribution.

***Business Segments:***

1. **Gaming & Network Services (G\&NS):** Develops, manufactures, and distributes gaming consoles, software, and related services, including PlayStation Network and subscription services like PlayStation Plus, generating $30b in revenue last year.

   a. Despite being one of the hottest narratives, Web3 gaming has yet to meaningfully take off, a result of subpar gameplay experiences. Conversely, backwards integrating Web3 functionality into established popular game franchises have a much higher chance of success.

2. **Music:** Handles the recording, production, and distribution of music worldwide, including music publishing (#1 globally), recorded music (#2 globally), and visual media & platform operations.  

   a. Sony plans to leverage blockchain to create decentralized platforms where creators can release content and protect their IP rights more effectively and directly monetize their work.

   b. Given the established popularity and sheer scale of Sony's music library, we believe backward integrating Web3 functionality will have more success than the previous generation of music-NFT projects.

# **3. TECHNICAL OVERVIEW** 
<a id="technical-overview"></a>

Soneium is an Ethereum Layer-2 (L2) blockchain, designed to enhance the scalability, speed, and cost-effectiveness of transactions on the Ethereum network. It utilizes the OP Stack framework, which is based on optimistic rollups—a technique that processes transactions off-chain and batches them for submission to the Ethereum mainnet. This method significantly reduces congestion and gas fees while maintaining the security of the underlying Ethereum blockchain by leveraging its consensus mechanisms and decentralized nature.

### Transaction Workflow

1. **User Initiates a Transaction**:  
   * Transactions (such as asset transfers or dApp interactions) are initiated in the user's wallet (e.g., MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet).   
2. **Transaction Submission to Base Layer**:  
   * Once the transaction is signed by the user, it is sent to the Soneium Sequencer.  
3. **Offchain Processing**:  
   * Transactions are sequenced and executed offchain, significantly reducing network congestion, latency, and cost.  
4. **Batching Transactions**:  
   * After processing, Soneium Sequencer aggregates multiple transactions into a single batch.  
   * This batch is then prepared for submission to Ethereum mainnet.  
5. **Submission to Ethereum Mainnet**:  
   * The batched transactions are posted on the Ethereum blockchain as a single entry using blobs. Unlike calldata, which remains permanently onchain, blobs are short-lived and can be pruned from clients after approximately 18 days.  
   * This reduces the data storage cost since blobs are cheaper than storing data directly on the Ethereum Mainnet in the form of calldata.  
   * Soneium's state (accounts, balances, contract code, etc.) is organized as a [Merkle tree](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/#merkle-trees) called a "state tree". The root of this Merkle tree (state root), which references the rollup's latest state, and old state roots, are hashed and stored in the rollup contract when posting batches.  
6. **Verification and Finalization**:  
   * Since the state difference and transaction data are public on Ethereum, anyone can execute the transactions and verify the batched transactions.  
   * Re-executing transactions on L1 to detect fraud requires publishing state commitments for individual transactions, which incurs significant gas costs. Soneium uses multi-round interactive proving, which achieves the same objective (i.e., detecting invalid rollup operations) much more efficiently.  
   * If someone disputes the state of Soneium, they use multi-round interactive proving to demonstrate that a false transaction was passed by the Sequencer.  
7. **User Receives Confirmation**:  
   * Once the batch is confirmed on Layer 1, users receive confirmation in their wallets that their transactions have been successfully completed. Currently, Soneium provides a pre-confirmation to the user before the batch is submitted to the Mainnet to improve the user experience.

**EVM Compatibility:**

Soneium is an EVM-compatible rollup, meaning the ecosystem is not starting from scratch. Developers who are familiar with Ethereum’s ecosystem will find it easy to transition to Soneium, as it supports the same programming languages and development tools.

* Developers can migrate existing smart contracts on Ethereum to Soneium without having to extensively modify codebases. This can save development teams time when deploying Ethereum smart contracts on Soneium.  
* Developers and project teams building on Soneium can take advantage of Ethereum's infrastructure, including programming languages, code libraries, testing tools, client software, deployment infrastructure, and so on.

Using existing tooling is important because they have been extensively audited, debugged, and improved over the years. It also eliminates the need for Ethereum developers to learn how to build with an entirely new development stack.

**How Soneium Fees Work:**

Soneium uses a gas fee scheme, much like Ethereum, to denote how much users pay per transaction. Fees charged on Soneium depend on the following components:

1. **Ethereum Mainnet**: Soneium's state (accounts, balances, contract code, etc.) is organized as a [Merkle tree](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/#merkle-trees) called a "state tree". The root of this Merkle tree (state root) is stored in the rollup contract on Ethereum, and Soneium pays this cost to Ethereum like normal transactions.  
2. **Blob gas used**: Soneium publishes transaction data and block headers (consisting of the previous block header hash, state root, and batch root) to Ethereum as a blob. Blobs employ a dynamic fee mechanism similar to [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559).  
3. **Soneium operator fees**: This is the operational cost incurred from processing transactions, much like gas fees on Ethereum. Soneium's profits \= total fees paid by the user \- (Sequencer operational cost \+ blob cost \+ Ethereum Mainnet cost).

**General-Purpose platform:**

Soneium is designed to be flexible and adaptable. While it is built to support a wide range of applications, its architecture allows for specific customisations based on the needs of different industries. This flexibility is crucial as it enables Soneium to cater to both individual developers and large enterprises, making it a versatile platform in the Web3 space.

**Technical differences between Soneium and Astar zkEVM:** 

The following table illustrates the key differences between Astar zkEVM and Soneium. By adopting the OP Stack, Soneium offers lower gas fees and presents a clear roadmap for scaling to billions of users. In contrast, Polygon zkEVM has faced reported reorg issues that have caused chain downtime in the past. Soneium addresses this concern by leveraging the OP Stack architecture.

# **4. BUSINESS MODEL & TOKENOMICS** 
<a id="business-model-&-tokenomics"></a>

***ASTR Utility & Value Accrual***

Due to potential legal issues, ***Soneium won’t launch a native token***, instead using ETH as the chain’s gas token. However, Sony understands the importance of offering the market an investable asset to help bootstrap the ecosystem flywheel, so ***they are committed to ensuring economic activity on Soneium directly accrues value to ASTR (Astar’s native token)***.

The ASTR token will have four primary functions on Soneium:

1. **Core ecosystem token:** ASTR is set to become Soneium’s core ecosystem token to encourage deep collaboration between builders, users, and the wider community. Although not confirmed by the team, we speculate the token will facilitate future revenue share opportunities and/or airdrops for holders.
2. **DeFi Routing Asset:** ASTR will function as the primary liquidity asset for DeFi applications on Soneium, helping bootstrap liquidity for new projects.  
3. **Payments:** Applications on Soneium will be economically incentivized to integrate ASTR, or stablecoins backed by ASTR, into their payment systems.  
4. **Staking and Security:** ASTR will be staked to secure critical infrastructure such as bridges and oracles within the Soneium ecosystem.

Note: Token utility has yet to be finalized and will likely evolve over time. However, given the aligned motivation to drive ASTR’s value, we have confidence the token will become a direct proxy of Soneium’s future economic activity. 

***Tokenomics***

 <img src="https://i.ibb.co/HFbxnTw/image17.png" alt="image25" style="width:75%;">


ASTR has a soft-capped yearly inflation and an uncapped maximum supply. Inflation is distributed among actors in the network in varying proportions, as shown above. As of this writing, 87% of total ASTR is in **Circulating Supply**. The portion of new emissions allocated to treasury and collators is fixed, however, as ASTR transitions into Soneium, the token inflation design may change.

# **5. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**
<a id="competitive-landscape"></a>

Although Soneium is technically a general purpose smart contract platform, its utility will always be closely tied to Sony. Therefore, we believe Base and TON are the most relevant competitors for comparison, since they also rely on Web2 counterpart distribution. 

Sony's established footprint in the entertainment and technology sectors provides a ready-made ecosystem for blockchain integration, potentially driving faster and more widespread adoption than what Telegram achieved with TON or Coinbase achieved with Base. Sony’s extensive user base and diverse consumer touch points serve as key differentiators for Soneium in the competitive Layer 2 market.

# **6. VALUATION & RETURNS ANALYSIS**
<a id="valuation-&-returns-analysis"></a>

***Comparable Assets***

As mentioned above, we believe the most relevant comps for Soneium (ASTR) are Toncoin (TON) and Base (no token), given their similarly close associations with established ecosystems. Sony is significantly larger than Telegram or Coinbase, dwarfing both in LTM revenue and valuation. If the market were to perceive a similar upside potential for ASTR as TON, the token would re-rate 71x (vs TON’s ATH). If the market factors in Sony’s much larger scale, ASTR’s upside FDV could be multiples higher. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/dM93zBF/image11.png" alt="image25" style="width: 60%;">

A more conservative analysis compares ASTR to other general-purpose L2 platforms, which also have higher valuations, albeit because they have had much more usage to-date. If Soneium can achieve similar activity to peers, it could re-rate 7.5x near-term. 

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/RQt6x2j/image12.png" alt="image25" style="width: 80%;">

***Long-Term Upside Potential***

Our long-term upside projects assume Soneium successfully leverages Sony’s Web3-relevant business segments (gaming, music, pictures) to offer differentiated and novel functionality via blockchain technology. To quantify this value, we project each business segment’s revenue through 2030 and assume Soneium “penetrates” (earns incremental revenue from Web3) 4% of each by 2030.

We believe Soneium’s revenue (economic activity) is the most practical valuation proxy, yielding an FDV of $43B (similar to TON’s ATH earlier this year) by applying a 10x multiple on 2030 revenue. This implies a 77x long-term upside potential for ASTR. 


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/JcDdtf9/image2.png" alt="image25" style="width: 41%;">


Although ASTR’s long-term value accrual mechanics are still uncertain, we believe Soneium’s revenue is the most practical valuation proxy, yielding an FDV of $43B (similar to TON’s ATH earlier this year) by applying a 10x multiple on 2030 revenue. This implies a 77x long-term upside potential. 

*Note: Although we do not include Sony’s financial services or hardware businesses in this forecast, we do think Soneium can leverage both to directly onboard end-users to Web3.*

***Testnet Traction:***

Despite being launched less than a month ago, the Soneium Minato Testnet has already shown impressive traction in the market:

* Managing more than 100,000 transactions daily  
* Attracting over 150,000 wallet addresses

These statistics are comparable to networks like Mode, Zora, Starknet, and Polygon zkEVM, which have been operational for a year. It is important to note that Minato is a testnet and not a mainnet; however, this early traction demonstrates the significant interest and potential for Soneium in the market.

Soneium has also secured partnerships with leading Web3 companies, including Circle, Chainlink, Alchemy, and The Graph, which will provide the essential infrastructure and services developers need.

# **8. KEY RISKS**
<a id="key-risks-1"></a>

1. **Nuanced ASTR value accrual:** ASTR’s long-term role and value accrual in the Soneium ecosystem is unique and still tentative, which may be a harder story for the market to get behind.  
   * *Mitigant:* Soneium (Sony) is committed to accruing meaningful ecosystem value to ASTR in order to bootstrap the economic flywheel.
2. **Execution risk:** Soneium’s goal of monetizing Sony’s world-class IP onchain is unprecedented and mainstream Web3 PMF has yet to be proven.  
   * *Mitigant:* This is true of any Web3 initiative that targets mass adoption, but we believe investors are sufficiently compensated for this risk given the token’s relatively low valuation today. 
3. **Imperfect parallels to TON/Telegram and Base/Coinbase:** These comparisons aren’t perfect considering both Telegram and Coinbase offered crypto-native and crypto-adjacent users. Sony will face a cold-start problem because its user base, while much larger than Coinbase or Telegram, has less crypto exposure and may be more difficult to monetize in Web3. 
   * *Mitigant:* Soneium is differentiated by Sony’s sheer relative scale and massive IP portfolio and has the strong backing from Sony’s top leadership.
