[Arweave (AR)](https://arweave.org/), in collaboration with AO Computer, is the industry’s only **permanent** and **verifiable** decentralized **full-stack** cloud provider, positioning the protocol to potentially become the premier Web3 data storage and hyperscale compute platform. We believe Arweave’s potential TAM and valuation upside is misunderstood and underappreciated by the market, leaving AR with a highly asymmetric risk/reward profile today.

# **1. PROTOCOL OVERVIEW** 
<a id="protocol-overview"></a>

Arweave’s storage infrastructure is **100% user-owned and tamper-proof.** This flexible platform lets users save any file type to the Arweave network and verify storage integrity, all with a one-time payment.  

The **Permaweb is the fully decentralized, future-proof internet** built on top of Arweave. It retains the functionality and user experience of the regular web, but all content is immutably stored and accessible on Arweave. 

Seven years after the protocol's initial launch, in February 2024, Arweave introduced **AO Computer, a hyper-parallel computing layer** to overlay its permanent data storage foundation. AO’s interoperable design aims to create an infinitely scalable and verifiable computation environment, facilitating a high-powered and trustless compute processor. 

# **2. INVESTMENT THESIS**
<a id="investment-thesis-1"></a>

1. **Permanent storage is uniquely required for blockchain data management**

   * As blockchain adoption grows, so does state and offchain data. Current models for impermanent, contract-based storage solutions are unsuitable for blockchains because they risk losing data, and storage costs compound super-linearly. Arweave’s one-time, perpetual storage design is aligned with future blockchain growth and data availability needs.   
       
2. **Differentiated strategy for scaling full-stack, trustless cloud services**

   * Centralized cloud service providers lack interoperability and heavily rely on trust, which is unsuitable for Web3 applications. On the other hand, blockchain networks are constrained by shared-thread architecture, which reduces computational load and onchain logic capabilities. Because of this cloud services gap, we believe Arweave has the potential to become the premier full-stack cloud platform for Web3.  
       
3. **Despite AO’s impressive rollout and early traction, the market misunderstands its unique technical design and long-term upside potential**

   * Within four weeks of release, AO processed over 1.5 million messages, hosted more than 30,000 processes, and attracted 3,000+ developers to its ecosystem. However, public mindshare doesn’t yet grasp the implications of AO’s unique utility, especially in the context of verifiable computing and scalable AI. Given the enormous future TAM, we believe AR can become one of the most valuable assets in the market.  

# **3. TECHNICAL OVERVIEW**
<a id="technical-overview"></a>

***Blockweave***

Arweave’s backbone is the Blockweave data structure. In the Blockweave, each block links to a random set of previous blocks rather than just the last block, creating a 3D weave structure instead of a linear chain.

![img](https://i.imgur.com/WLM9iXK.png[/img])


**This means that Arweave is not a traditional blockchain.** Instead, the Arweave team took inspiration from blockchains and engineered their own lightweight and data-redundant architecture. 

* **Succinct Random Proof of Access (SPoRA):** Miners in the Arweave network are rewarded for generating new blocks. Since miners must access and verify specified historical blocks to create new ones, they are incentivized to replicate previous blocks. This mechanism increases Arweave’s data security and redundancy while also limiting energy waste.


![img](https://i.imgur.com/Te6oYAm.png[/img])

* **Blockshadows:** Instead of moving massive blocks across the network, Arweave only distributes “shadows” — or block recreation instructions. This separates transaction and block storage, which has enabled 500+ transactions per second and unlimited block sizes on Arweave.  
    
* **Wildfire Retrieval:** Wildfire operates on the principle of 'if you share with me, I will share with you'. Since nodes in blockweave networks require quick data access for efficient mining, they are incentivized to promptly and continuously share data with another network participant. This sharing dynamic accelerates Arweave's data transfer speeds and boosts network redundancy through Blockweave linking. 

***Permaweb*** 

Arweave uses the Blockweave for its decentralized version of the Internet called the Permaweb. Anyone can quickly access and upload any file type without fear of future data deletion or censorship. 

<img width="829" alt="image3" src="https://i.imgur.com/RZhO2Wm.png">

* **Network of Idle Resources:** The permaweb leverages unused hard drive space across its network, similar to how sharing economy platforms like Airbnb work. This model incentivizes data replication and storage capacity, allowing website creators to pay only for the actual storage used rather than for underutilized server capacity. 

![img](https://i.imgur.com/zQknWeq.png[/img])

***AO Computer (AO)***

AO Computer is a modular computing layer that stores processes on Arweave’s “data availability layer ". **AO's parallel computing environment unlocks increasingly complex logic and flexible security on blockchains, enabling new onchain categories, including scalable AI/ML (LLMs) and autonomous agents.**

<img width="648" alt="image18" src="https://i.imgur.com/epsXu0y.png">


AO stands for Actor Oriented, an homage to the programming language Erlang, which allows concurrent and independent modification of private states. If one state wishes to interact with or modify another, it must communicate with global messages for consensus. AO uses Erlang’s distributed model and uses a three-unit system to organize and execute computations.


<img width="468" alt="image4" src="https://i.imgur.com/s2FTQsL.png">


***Processes*** 

A process is executable code representing a state change in AO. Processes can be considered like smart contracts \-- they are customizable computing environments that can also access Arweave’s permanent storage. 

To create a process, developers write several parameters, such as the scheduler unit, the underlying virtual machine (VM), and memory limits. Then, each process operates independently and is represented as a series of ordered logs (messages) written to Arweave. Processes interact with each other through these messages, facilitating parallelization via an immutable state log. 

***AO Units***

![img](https://i.imgur.com/EmnDUOt.png[/img])

**Messages and Messenger Units (MU):** Messenger Units relay messages by interacting with Scheduler Units (ordering) and Compute Units to fulfill requests. This three unit architecture defines an universal standard across AO processes, ensuring efficient communication between separate private states and applications.

**Scheduler Units (SU):** Scheduler Units in AO are analogous to rollup sequencers. Their job is to order and sort messages that will eventually be written on Arweave. Every AO process is associated with a Scheduler Unit, ensuring systematic and reliable message handling. The message log serves an immutable state record that other processes can later access. Importantly, AO optimistically assumes concurrent state changes made with a singular scheduler will not cause dependency issues. This is because message execution is global, and the same scheduler accounts for every message. 

**Compute Units (CU):** Compute Units represent the computational power for updating AO processes. Messenger Units notify Compute Units when their services are required, creating a marketplace where Compute Units compete based on price and performance. This distributed approach contrasts with traditional blockchains, where every node processes all transactions and race conditions emerge. After computation, Compute Units provide a signed attestation of the output to the originating Messenger Unit, ensuring process integrity and accuracy. 

***Parallel Processing*** 

**Holographic states**: Holographic State enables asynchronous state verification without running into double spending issues. Instead of requiring all nodes to calculate the state continuously, the state is inferred from the message log stored on Arweave. Compute Units can reconstruct the current state by replaying the message log from the beginning, reducing computational load and allowing for independent state evaluation.  

**Consensus Mechanism \- Continued:** AO achieves consensus on the input data (messages) and their order rather than the state or outcome of computations. Scheduler Units assign ordered slots to messages, which are then stored on Arweave, creating an immutable, chronological log. Again, Compute Units can simply replay the log to calculate the current state, simplifying consensus and boosting network efficiency.

***Arweave Integration***

Arweave is critical to AO's architecture because it provides permanent storage for computational states and ensures data availability. AO’s entire message history is holographically available on Arweave, meaning anyone can verify computation results by replaying the log. Arweave is also responsible for the  component swapping on AO, including interchanging virtual machines, schedulers, and messaging layers.

AO is just one example of Arweave's unbounded hard drive infrastructure. Users can now build on Arweave’s entirely decentralized cloud without any trust assumptions.

***AI on AO*** 

We believe Arweave’s permanent storage and scalable compute will be the core building blocks for both a deterministic and adaptive AI future. The AI on AO initiative has successfully introduced support for LLMs within smart contracts, effectively building the infrastructure to revolutionize AI development in a trustless environment. Key new features include:

* **WASM64 Support**: Enabling developers to create applications that utilize more than 4GB of RAM, supporting large-scale models like Llama 3\.

* **WeaveDrive**: Providing seamless access to Arweave as a local hard drive, offering unbounded storage at minimal cost

* **Hyper Parallel Processing Mechanisms**: Allowing large-scale computation without affecting neighboring processes.

This convergence of AI and crypto transforms AO into a decentralized supercomputer capable of running sophisticated AI applications and agents, all within the bounds of trustless smart contracts. With over 3,000 developers involved, early applications like trading bots and decentralized recommendation systems are already emerging within the AO ecosystem. 

It's still early days, but we are extremely excited about the next generation of Web3 and AI innovations being built on AO and Arweave’s cloud infrastructure.

# **4. BUSINESS MODEL & TOKENOMICS**
<a id="business-model-tokenomics"></a>

**Permanence Guarantee via Endowment:** Users pay a one-time fee in the native AR token to store data permanently on Arweave. This fee is placed into an endowment that generates perpetual revenue for sustained miner services, guaranteeing 200 years of data storage from a one-time user fee. 

![img](https://i.imgur.com/Q34OCFo.png[/img])


**Dynamic Pricing Model:** Arweave conservatively assumes a perpetual 0.5% decrease in storage cost per year, which means the price for indefinite storage is actually a finite number. Mining will then continue as long as the block reward is greater than the cost required to maintain the blockweave for that same period (can be infinite time because marginal storage cost approaches zero). 

![img](https://i.imgur.com/nMXfw2n.png[/img])

To maintain stability, Arweave opted for a dollar \- rather than AR \- price range per permanent GB, which has historically ranged between $3 and $8 per GB. Essentially, Arweave’s storage costs only fluctuate based on the network difficulty, which should continue decreasing overtime. 

***AR Tokenomics***

**Token Supply:** Arweave started with a Genesis supply of 55 million AR tokens and a maximum circulation of 66 million tokens. New token issuance follows a similar continuous halving model to Bitcoin, with \~64 million AR tokens currently issued. Around 22% of the issued tokens are held by advisors, the project team or reserved for future use. 

![img](https://i.imgur.com/vhIUNsg.png[/img])


**Token Utility:** 

1. ***Payment for Storage:*** Users pay for data storage on the Arweave network using AR tokens. This payment ensures that the data is stored perpetually on the Arweave blockchain. The unique economic model of Arweave means that users pay once for data storage, and the network ensures its storage indefinitely by incentivizing miners with the AR token.

2. ***Mining Rewards:*** Miners, who contribute storage space and computational power to the network, are rewarded with AR tokens. This incentivizes participants to maintain the network, ensuring its security and reliability.

3. ***Network Governance:*** Holders of AR tokens can participate in the governance of the network. This includes voting on key decisions that affect the future of the Arweave ecosystem, such as protocol upgrades and changes to the economic model.

**Value Accrual:** The value of AR tokens increases linearly with storage demand on Arweave. Since transaction fees are sent to Arweave’s endowment, tokens are temporarily removed from circulation. For instance, with a network growth to 10PB and fees at \~200 AR per TB, about 1.7 million tokens would be removed from circulation. These tokens will re-enter the market gradually as miners sell them to cover storage costs.

***AO Tokenomics***

**Token Supply:** AO has a continuous four-year halving cycle with a total supply of 21 million tokens. 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/zPz19yE.png" alt="image25" style="width: 30%;">
</div>

**Token Utility:**

1. *Operating Fees:* Developers use AO tokens to pay for the computational resources and services needed to run their decentralized applications on the Arweave network. This includes things like smart contract execution, data querying, and other dApp-related functions.

2. *Incentives for dApp Developers:* The AO token is also used to incentivize developers to create and maintain high-quality applications on the Arweave network. This can include rewards for developing new features, fixing bugs, or optimizing the performance of dApps.

3. ***Staking and Security:*** In some cases, AO tokens can be staked by developers or users to gain access to certain features or to participate in securing specific applications. This helps ensure the reliability and security of dApps running on the Arweave network.

**Dual Value Accrual:** As AO's usage grows, so does AO’s price and the number of messages stored on Arweave. Thus, AO usage indirectly drives up the demand \- and price \- of AR tokens. 

**Minting and Distribution:** There is no pre-mining or token sale for AO. Instead, all tokens will follow Bitcoin’s economic distribution model. Retrospective minting began on February 27, 2024, with all newly mined tokens being distributed to Arweave holders. After June 18, 2024, 33.3% of AO tokens are minted and distributed to AR holders every 5 minutes, while 66.6% will be given to users who bridge assets like stETH to AO. 

# **5. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE** 
<a id="competitive-landscape"></a>

***Decentralized Storage Platforms***

**Filecoin** retains 81% of Web3 data, making it the leader in storage services. However, its early market lead can be mostly attributed to aggressive token incentives, which inorganically lowered storage prices and poorly impacted the FIL token. There is also no guarantee of permanence on Filecoin, meaning that the data is unretrievable once users stop subscribing. 

**Jackal** offers geo-distributed (not fully decentralized) storage and integrates seamlessly with other blockchains through IBC. Jackal also maintains three copies of each stored item for increased data redundancy. 

|  | Jackal | Filecoin | Arweave |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Storage Type** | Geo-distributed cloud storage ecosystem | Decentralized, verifiable storage via IPFS | Permanent, decentralized, and verifiable storage   |
| **Data Retrieval** | Smart contract call over IBC | Miners retrieve data in exchange for FIL tokens  | Unique hash recall |

| **Security** | Proof-of-Persistence  | Proof-of-Replication, Proof-of-Spacetime | Succinct Random Proof-of-Access  |
| **Pricing** | Prices set by decentralized governance  | Prices set by market, but high volatility and decreasing FIL price due to token incentives  | Pricing set by network difficulty, but target range for $/GB (permanent) |
| **Token Incentives** | Yes | Yes | No  |

***Decentralized Compute Platforms***

**Filecoin VM** integrates with the Filecoin storage network to support smart contracts and decentralized applications. Its architecture depends on storage providers and retrieval miners, leading to historically variable performance. 

**Fluence** employs a customizable node-based compute environment, allowing developers to define each node's specific compute tasks. This architecture supports high scalability and interoperability, making it versatile for various compute-heavy applications. 

**Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)** operates with a canister-based smart contract system within its subnet framework. This design ensures high scalability and robust security, facilitated by Chain Key Technology for fast transactions. ICP's architecture is well-suited for large-scale web applications and services, providing extensive compute resources and seamless integration capabilities.

|  | Filecoin VM | AO  | Fluence | ICP |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Architecture** | WASM-based VM for smart contract execution | Parallel computer using Arweave for data storage  | Serverless DePIN for offchain compute  | WASM-based  smart contracts for onchain compute  |
| **Scalability** | Medium, can scale with coprocessors and L2s | High, parallel processing allows for theoretically infinite scaling | High, offchain compute enables horizontal scaling | Medium, subnets and sharding, but replicated compute model has limitations  |
| **Security** | High, Proof-of-Replication Proof-of-Spacetime  | High, flexible security models with planned PoS mechanism | High, configurable security per node | High,  Chain Key Technology |
| **Interoperability** | High, multi-chain support via Axelar and Celer  | High, multi-chain support like Ethereum and Solana  | High, multi-chain support like Ethereum and Filecoin \+ IPC  | Medium, some integrations with Bitcoin and Ethereum.  |
| **Smart Contracts Composability** | Yes, supports Solidity and other WASM-compatible languages | Yes, supports Smartweave contracts with custom logic  | Not specifically designed for smart contracts | Yes, canister-based smart contracts can interact across subnets |
| **Verification** | Yes, verifiable proofs posted onchain | Yes, verifiable compute logs on Arweave | Yes, proofs of computation posted onchain | Yes, threshold signatures verify  outputs onchain |
| **Coprocessors** | Not implemented, but could theoretically support  | Yes | Yes | Limited, focus on onchain subnet execution |

# **6. VALUATION & RETURNS ANALYSIS** 
<a id="valuation-returns-analysis"></a>


## ***Relative Valuation***

Given Arweave’s novel networking architecture and functionality (mix of L1 and cloud services), there are no perfect liquid comps, yet we believe it’s appropriate to compare the protocol to both L1s smart contract platforms and non-L1 cloud services platforms. AR’s peers have a wide range of valuations, but average $47.6B in FDV today, representing 25.9x upside to Arweave’s current FDV.

![img](https://i.imgur.com/ufjxuFm.png[/img])


## ***Total Addressable Market (TAM) & Upside Potential***

[Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cloud-computing-industry#:~:text=The%20global%20cloud%20computing%20market%20size%20was%20estimated,are%20realizing%20the%20transformative%20power%20of%20cloud%20computing.) projects the global Web2 cloud computing market will grow 21.2% from 2023 to 2030, but for simplicity we assume a 20% CAGR over the time period. If Web3 can penetrate 5% of the cloud market by 2030, we believe a reasonable assumption for an upside scenario, Arweave’s TAM will be $108B. Looking at current market share dynamics in Web2, if Arweave can become a leading player in the category (top 3), they’ll likely capture 20% of the Web3 market. Applying a 10x multiple in 2030, which is reasonable given the implied revenue growth rate, Arweave would be worth $216B, ***representing an attractive 117x upside to today’s valuation\!***

# **8. KEY RISKS**
<a id="key-risks-1"></a>

1. **Underwhelming Product Market Fit:** Arweave and AO must incentivize developers to build sticky products and bridge users to stay for the long haul. 

    *Mitigants:* 
  
     * AO’s full capabilities won’t be unlocked until mainnet is launched in 2H 2025; until then, AR/AO adoption metrics aren’t as indicative of long-term usage.
     
     * As Web3 adoption increases, valuable data requiring permanent storage will grow exponentially, driving demand for Arweave.
     
     * The Arweave and AO-based application ecosystem is multiplying. Prominent chains like Solana, Cosmos, and Polkadot all use Arweave and the AO’s AI promise is spreading contagiously. 


2. **Cost Competition:** Arweave's upfront cost is higher than pay-as-you-go alternatives. Enterprises and smaller blockchains may exclusively choose a cloud service provider based on cost. 

    *Mitigants:*
   
     * We anticipate AO Computer and Arweave will attract a new class of use cases and applications that require secure, permanent storage and are willing to pay an upfront premium for verifiably future-proof and 100% user-controlled storage. These use-cases include Web3-specific applications and trustless AI.
      
     * Over longer time periods, Arweave's pricing model can become cheaper than subscription-based services.


4. **Endowment Stability:** Arweave's economic model assumes storage costs will continuously decrease over time. If this assumption proves incorrect, it could destabilize the endowment and impact long-term data maintenance.

   *Mitigant:*

      * Arweave conservatively estimates a 0.5% annual decline in storage costs for fee calculations, compared to the historic 50-year average of 30% per year. This cautious approach ensures the economic model’s sustainability for at least 200 years.
